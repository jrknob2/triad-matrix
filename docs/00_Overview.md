# 00 — Overview

## What Triad Trainer Is

Triad Trainer is a **drummer-first practice tool** focused on one thing:

> Helping drummers internalize triad stickings so they become usable musical vocabulary.

It is not about theory, genres, or collecting patterns.
It is about **repetition, feel, and physical reality**.

Triad Trainer exists to answer the question:
> “What should I play *right now* to get better at triads?”

## The Problem It Solves

Many drummers:
- Know triads conceptually
- Have seen triad matrices and permutations
- Can execute them slowly or intellectually

But struggle to:
- Make triads feel musical
- Move them around a kit naturally
- Practice them consistently without overthinking
- Bridge pad work into real kit flow

Most tools either:
- Generate *random* permutations with no musical grounding, or
- Present *static exercises* with no variation or adaptability

Triad Trainer sits between those extremes.

---

## Who This Is For

Triad Trainer is designed for drummers who:

- Practice regularly (pad, kick pad, or full kit)
- Want structured material without rigid lesson plans
- Care about feel, phrasing, and flow
- Prefer **doing** over configuring

It explicitly supports the progression many drummers experience:

1. Pad only  
2. Pad + kick  
3. Full kit (acoustic or electronic)

The app grows with the drummer’s physical setup.

## Core Philosophy

### Drummer reality first
If something would feel confusing, awkward, or physically implausible on an instrument, it does not belong.

### Constraints create clarity
We prefer fewer options with strong defaults over many knobs.

### Practice > features
If a feature does not directly help someone practice more effectively, it should not exist in v1.

### Vocabulary over permutations
Triads are musical language, not math problems.
The goal is fluency, not coverage.

## What This App Is Not

Triad Trainer is **not**:

- A DAW
- A groove player
- A notation editor
- A genre simulator
- A pattern library manager

Those tools already exist.
This app fills a different gap.

---

## Design Mindset

When making decisions, we ask:

- Does this help someone practice triads *right now*?
- Does this reduce friction or add it?
- Would a real drummer understand this without explanation?
- Does this respect physical reality?

If the answer is unclear, we simplify.

---

## Long-Term Vision (Context Only)

While v1 is intentionally small, the long-term vision includes:
- Better insight into practice habits
- Visual orchestration on a drum kit
- Animated feedback driven by pattern data
- Deeper integration with tools like DraftX

These ideas are intentionally **out of scope** for v1.
They are documented elsewhere to prevent scope creep.

## Why This Document Exists

This overview is the anchor.

As the project evolves, this file should still read as true.
If future changes make this document inaccurate, that is a signal
to reconsider the direction.

This app should always feel like:
> Sitting down to practice — not configuring software.
